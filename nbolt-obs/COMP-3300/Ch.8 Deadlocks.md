# System Model

# Deadlock Characterization
(Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait)

# Resource-allocation graph

# Deadlock prevention
(eliminating necessary conditions)

# Deadlock avoidance
(safe states, Banker's algorithm)

# Deadlock detection
(detection algorithm, recovery from deadlock, resource preemption)
