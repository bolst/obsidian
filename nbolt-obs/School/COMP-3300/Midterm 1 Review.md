## Algorithm Simulations & Scheduling Concepts

### Types of Queue Times

#### Waiting Time

Waiting time is the time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.

Can be calculated via either `start time - arrival time` or `turnaround time - burst time`.

#### Turnaround Time

Turnaround time is the time from when a process arrives to when it completes.

Can be calculated via `completion time - arrival time`.

#### Response Time

Response time is the time from when a process arrives to when it first executes.

Can be calculated via `time of first execution - arrival time`.
